#### Review 1:
* The journey of reinventing the European Electricity Landscape - Challenges and pioneers*
- The 20-20-20 renewable energy directive:
	- Reduce greenhouse gas emission by 20%
	- Increase the amount of energy consumption originating from RE to 20%
	- Improve energy efficiency by 20% in relation to projections
	
- Policy makers are not only concerned by the growing threat of climate change but also the geopolitical considerations about security of supply and the dependency of foreign imports of oil and gas.
- While adopting RE is paramount in deflecting the adverse effects of climate change, the uptake is facing dire challenges such as:
	- Slow growth of some EU members states (esp. southern Europe)
	- The dependency on the global resolution to climate change
	- The serious security-of-supply issues
	- Policies by members states where some face out nuclear energy and others invest in it
	
- The EU has recognized that the market stakeholders need clarity regarding the long term policy framework before investing in new infrastructure. 
- Renewable integration in Europe - challenges and policy responses:
	- Locational constraints
	- Market design
	
- Norway and Sweden are known as the "battery of Europe" because of their abundant resource of hydropower which provides balancing power for weather dependent wind and solar power generation.
- There is need to realize the potential of offshore wind in the North Sea (NSCOGI). It aims to connect the offshore wind farms around the British Isles with balancing capacity in the Nordic countries.
- Countries with large amount of wind power like Denmark have shown that great progress can be achieved by using existing infrastructure more efficiently and by relatively modest investments in modeling tools at control room level.
- TWENTIES: Transmission system operation with large penetration of wind and other renewable electricity sources in Networks by means of innovative tools and integrated energy solutions.
