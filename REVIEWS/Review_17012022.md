### Communication technologies in Distributed Energy Resources (DERs)

- [ ] New standard communication model enables grid operators to enance performance and value of DERs.
- [ ] Primary protocols or standards such as: 
       - IEEE 1547 (2018)
       - IEC 61850 (-7-420, -90-7)
       - IEEE 1815 (DNP3)
       - IEEE 2030.5 (SEP2)
       - OpenADR 2.0
       - SunSpec Modbus
- [ ] Review of primary DER messaging use cases.
- [ ] Information models develop a way to represent measurements, status values, alarms, controls/commands, and configuration/capabilities. 
- [ ] The communication protocol allows information model to be shared with other devices.
- [ ] Scaling DER management requires standard models for end device functions and integration with multiple protocols in a system is faster and easier.
- [ ] Accelerate interoperable DER management systems.
- [ ] Pre-defined models can allow greater scalability and data interoperability.
- [ ] Engineered SCADA systems are highly customizable; standardized DER functionality for highly scalable and secure systems
