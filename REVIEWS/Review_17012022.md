### Communication technologies in Distributed Energy Resources (DERs)

- [ ] New standard communication model enables grid operators to enance performance and value of DERs.
- [ ] Primary protocols or standards such as: 
       - IEEE 1547 (2018)
       - IEC 61850 (-7-420, -90-7)
       - IEEE 1815 (DNP3)
       - IEEE 2030.5 (SEP2)
       - OpenADR 2.0
       - SunSpec Modbus
- [ ] Review of primary DER messaging use cases.
- [ ] Information models develop a way to represent measurements, status values, alarms, controls/commands, and configuration/capabilities. 
- [ ] The communication protocol allows information model to be shared with other devices.
- [ ] Scaling DER management requires standard models for end device functions and integration with multiple protocols in a system is faster and easier.
- [ ] Accelerate interoperable DER management systems.
- [ ] Pre-defined models can allow greater scalability and data interoperability.
- [ ] Engineered SCADA systems are highly customizable; standardized DER functionality for highly scalable and secure systems


#### Applying IED 61850 to Distributed Energy Resources (DER)
- [ ] Traditionally, all the distributed energy resources were added to the grid at HV but the utility industry is in transition as there is multi-directional power flow, model based operational applications, and numerous DERs added to the grid at lower levels such as MV and LV
- [ ] The growth of data requires a new approach for OT applications in the model based integration using CIM and IEC 61850
- [ ] The utility is required to connect and control both utility and 3rd party DER in a neutral manner using existing systems. The utility is resource constrained to undertake the engineering to interconnect so many different projects
- [ ] Product implementation complexity does not result in application complexity. Even through user configuration using numbered tags is understandable overall system complexity is increased. In so doing, Sun Spec developed Modbus which is termed a *simpler* communication protocol for the grid connected inverters. 
- [ ] The utility Dilemma. What is it? *Solution: Use IEC 61850 and DNP3 together. The system design and naming standard will be done using IEC 61850 engineering tools and data models. All communications will be through a DNP3 gateway. Each project owner provides a DNP3 gateway that conforms to a standardized template that conforms to IEC 61850-7-420 and the IEEE 1816 DER profile under development. 

*Will it be simple to integrate 600K homes with utility scale applications and build an intelligent grid leveraging solar resources using Modbus?Perhaps not. Standards like IEC61850-7-420 are being improved to address these needs*
